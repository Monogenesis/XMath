# XMath

This is a growing math library for game engine development written in C++.

## Motivation

I always wanted to create my own game engine from scratch. Because there is a lot of math involed in game engines I started to create my own math library. The book series ["Foundations of Game Engine Development"](https://foundationsofgameenginedev.com/), currently book 1, guides me with the project.
