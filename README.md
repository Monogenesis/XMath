# XMath

This is a growing math library for game engine development written in C++.

## Motivation

I always wanted to create my own game engine from scratch. Because there is a lot of math involed in game engines I started to create my own math library. The book series ["Foundations of Game Engine Development"](https://foundationsofgameenginedev.com/), currently book 1, guides me with the project.

## Current features

* 3 dimensionnal vector operations
* 3 dimensional matrix operations

## Lessons learned

* Vector and matrix algebra
* Learning C++
